DNS seeding for infnote

Infnote-seeder
==============

Infnote-seeder is a crawler for the Infnote network, which exposes a list
of reliable nodes via a built-in DNS server.

Features:
* regularly revisits known nodes to check their availability
* bans nodes after enough failures, or bad behaviour


REQUIREMENTS
------------

$ pip install dnslib gevent socketserver pylru

$ sudo nohup python infnote_dns.py &

$ nohup python run_crawler_regularly.py &


RUNNING AS NON-ROOT
-------------------

Typically, you'll need root privileges to listen to port 53 (name service).

One solution is using an iptables rule (Linux only) to redirect it to
a non-privileged port:

$ iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-port 5353

If properly configured, this will allow you to run dnsseed in userspace, using
the -p 5353 option.
